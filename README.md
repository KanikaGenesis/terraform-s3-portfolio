# Website Hosting with Terraform and Amazon S3

This repository demonstrates the use of **Terraform** to automate the creation and configuration of infrastructure for hosting my Cloud Portfolio as a **static website** on **Amazon S3**. By using Terraform, I achieved a seamless and efficient process for deploying and managing cloud resources.


## Features

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Automates the creation of resources using Terraform.
- **Static Hosting on S3:** Configures the S3 bucket for public access with an `index.html` and `error.html`.
- **Reproducibility:** Easily destroy and rebuild the infrastructure using `terraform destroy` and `terraform apply` commands.
- **Cost-Efficient:** Uses S3, which provides low-cost hosting for static websites.
